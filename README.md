# New-Zealand-River-Visualization-based-on-Optimal-Channel-Network
This is my dissertation, which uses the REC2 (River Environment Classification, v2.3) dataset from NIWA and DEM (Digital Elevation Model) to visual the New Zealand river network and store the detail information of the river network such as elevation and speed of the river in a river class object for further analysis.
