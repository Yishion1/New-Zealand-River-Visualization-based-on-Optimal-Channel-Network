# New-Zealand-River-Visualization-based-on-Optimal-Channel-Network
This is my dissertation, which uses the REC2 (River Environment Classification, v2.3) dataset from NIWA and DEM (Digital Elevation Model) to visual the New Zealand river network and store the detail information of the river network such as elevation and speed of the river in a river class object for further analysis.

# 3.12：
Function：Extract the river network according to the HydroID in REC2， visualize the river network using OCN and store the data in river class objects.

To Do：1.Find ways to simulate the population of trout in NZ river, maybe take the average number

       2. Simulatie the mobility,see (Movement and Mortality of Adult Brown Trout in the Motupiko River, New Zealand: Effects of Water Temperature, Flow, and Flooding) 
       
       Most of the tagged fish moved only a
short distance during the study, around 64% moving
less than 1,000 m. Rates of movement ranged from 0 to
801 m/d and averaged 22.5 m/d, although this mean
was heavily skewed by the largest movements. The
geometric mean movement rate was 0.68 m/d

      3. Simulate the probility that trout go upstream or downstream, most trout stay downstream.
